\textcolor{purple}{What knowledge is necessary to}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{purple}{understand design decisions you made, e.g. how did you choose the quantisation algorithm?}
    \item \textcolor{purple}{understand why your research question is important, e.g. why should we quantise CNNs?}

\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}
A common form of DNNs is Convolution Neural Networks(CNN), consist of multiple 2D convolution layer commonly known as CONV layers, see figure \ref{fig:conv}.
